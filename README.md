# CINDH-Orphans-Day-Snake-Game
This project is a simple, fun implementation of the classic Snake Game built with Python and Pygame.  It was created specifically for the CINDH Club's "La Journée des Orphelins" event to serve as an entertaining and interactive activity for the children attending.  This game is a contribution of the GameDev Cell from the EITC Club (ENSIAS).
